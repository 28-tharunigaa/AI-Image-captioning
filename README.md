# AI Image Captioning

## Introduction

AI Image Captioning is a technology that combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate textual descriptions of images. This project implements an AI-based image captioning model using deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism.

## Features
- Preprocesses input images for deep learning models.
- Extracts image features using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, Inception).
- Generates captions using an RNN or Transformer model with attention.
- Produces human-readable captions for various types of images.
- Supports integration with real-time applications.

## Usage

1. Run the script to generate captions for images:
   ```bash
   python caption_generator.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

2. The output will display the generated caption for the input image.

## Workflow

1. **Input Image Acquisition**: The system receives an image from the user.
2. **Preprocessing**: The image is resized and normalized for model compatibility.
3. **Feature Extraction**: A CNN extracts meaningful features from the image.
4. **Caption Generation**: An RNN/Transformer-based model generates a textual description.
5. **Output Display**: The generated caption is displayed to the user.

## Example

```bash
python caption_generator.py --image_path sample.jpg
```
**Output:** "A dog playing with a frisbee in the park."
